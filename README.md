# Finnums
Financial numbers (decimal (2) fixed point) - my own version!

Two -decimals scaled (i.e. scale=100) integers for finance operations.

Operations defined on FinNums
  add,substract give a FinNum
  multiply is an error
  (divide give a Float -> see others)
  others convert to float by promotion
